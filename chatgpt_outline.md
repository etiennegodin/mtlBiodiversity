roject Roadmap: Montreal Biodiversity Dashboard
1. Define the Vision

Goal: Create an interactive dashboard showing biodiversity patterns across Montreal’s parks.

Audience: City of Montreal, NGOs, citizens interested in urban ecology.

Features:

Map of parks with biodiversity indicators (species richness, sightings, habitat types).

Charts for species counts, seasonal variation, trends over time.

Search by species or park.

"Storytelling" sections highlighting key insights (e.g. hotspots for pollinators, invasive species alerts).

2. Collect and Prepare Data

Possible datasets:

iNaturalist API: observations of species in Montreal.

GBIF (Global Biodiversity Information Facility): occurrence records.

City of Montreal Open Data: park boundaries, land use, tree inventories.

Environment Canada / eBird: birds in Montreal.

Steps:

Fetch raw data (API queries or CSVs).

Clean and filter to Montreal boundary.

Spatial join: match observations to park polygons.

Create aggregated metrics:

Species richness per park.

Number of observations per year.

Most observed taxa.

Seasonal trends (e.g. spring vs. fall diversity).

3. Exploratory Analysis

In Python:

Libraries: pandas, geopandas, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly.

Key analyses:

Top 10 most observed species in Montreal.

Species diversity distribution across parks.

Temporal trend of biodiversity observations (is citizen science growing?).

Map hotspots of species richness.

4. Build Interactive Visuals

Choose framework:

Streamlit (easiest, rapid dashboard building).

Dash (Plotly) (more customizable, but more setup).

Panel / Bokeh (flexible, good for geospatial).

Elements:

Map: Leaflet or Plotly Mapbox to show parks and biodiversity indices.

Charts: Interactive bar charts, line charts, sunburst (for taxonomy).

Filters: Dropdowns for park name, taxon group (birds, plants, fungi).

Search: Lookup species and see where it’s found in Montreal.

5. Design the Dashboard Layout

Sections:

Overview: Key stats (total species observed, number of parks, most observed taxa).

Map Explorer: Montreal parks colored by biodiversity richness.

Species Explorer: Charts for top species, trends by year/month.

Park Profiles: Click a park → view biodiversity report card.

Insights/Stories: Highlight key findings (pollinator hotspots, invasive species).

6. Add Narrative + Branding

Since this is a fake proposal:

Add a title + branding: “Montreal Urban Biodiversity Dashboard” with logos (mock City/NGO).

Include “why it matters” text: ecological monitoring, citizen engagement, urban planning.

End with a proposal note: “This dashboard could help the City of Montreal and NGOs track biodiversity, engage citizens, and guide park management.”

7. Deploy

Deploy with Streamlit Cloud, Heroku, or Render so others can interact with it online.

Add GitHub repo with:

Code

Data sources + pipeline

Documentation (README with screenshots).

8. Optional Advanced Features

Trend forecasting: Use time-series models for biodiversity growth.

Network graphs: Show species–park associations.

Image integration: Display species photos from iNaturalist API.

Mobile-friendly layout for citizen engagement.

✅ By the end, you’ll have:

A polished, interactive dashboard.

A portfolio project showcasing data wrangling, geospatial analysis, visualization, and storytelling.

Something that looks like a real applied data science project for the city/NGO.
